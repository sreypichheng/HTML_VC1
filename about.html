      <h1>Education</h1>
         <p>The education needs of each student can vary greatly. A child’s learning style, performance level, family situation, health, and unique interests all contribute to the type of education he or she needs. Other factors that can influence the quality of a student’s education include the learning environment, the curriculum, the quality of the teachers, and the student’s individual experience—whether he is motivated or bored, feels safe or is being bullied, is focused or distracted. Fortunately, parents today have many options to ensure their children receive the personalized education experience they need to succeed. Read about trending and ongoing education issues on Learning Liftoff and how parents can best address the challenges their children face.</p>
